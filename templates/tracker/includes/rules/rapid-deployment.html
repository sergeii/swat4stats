Three to five bombs are randomly spawned in the map. SWAT must use the toolkit to defuse all of the bombs before the round ends.  The Suspects must defend the bombs and prevent them from being disabled. Once all of the bombs are defused SWAT wins. If the round timer expires while a bomb is still active, the Suspects win.
