The suspects must collect the briefcase and take it to the exit before the timer runs out. The officers must stop the suspects from reaching the exit with the briefcase. If a suspect is arrested, 30 seconds are deducted from the game clock. If a suspect is killed or arrested carrying the briefcase, the case stays where it is dropped. Officers cannot pickup the briefcase.
